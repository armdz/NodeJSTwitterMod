###Twitter Mod & Download Data

NodeJS implementation to download tweets and his media based on a hashtag.
Moderator is under construction, for now download all the tweets , profile image and media (if the tweet has).

###Usage

node main.js NAME_OF_THE_PROJECT

NAME_OF_THE_PROJECT = create a folder with this structure:

output/NAME_OF_THE_PROJECT/data.json <-- the tweets
output/NAME_OF_THE_PROJECT/profile <-- profile image
output/output/NAME_OF_THE_PROJECT/media <-- the media (like attached pictures in tweet)

###Note

Check "config.json" to set the api data and some stuff like search interval, hastags, language ...

I promise a best readme.md shortly.
